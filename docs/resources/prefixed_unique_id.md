# internals_prefixed_unique_id (Resource)

The resource `internals_prefixed_unique_id` makes available the sdk helper function
`PrefixedUniqueId` which is used by resources such as aws_s3_bucket to name a bucket from
the bucket_prefix argument.

The prefix will be appended with 26 characters.

This resource was created to solve the issue of circular dependencies i.e. when using `bucket_prefix` and
requiring a logging configuration to use the bucket name for the `target_prefix`.

To use this resource, define it and use the `id` attribute to set resource name/id instead
of using the built in *_prefix arguments.
